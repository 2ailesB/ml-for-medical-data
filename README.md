To do this project, we have chosen a classification dataset called "Classify gestures by reading muscle activity" and available at : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kyr7plus/emg-4. It aims at doing prediction of gestures (between rock, paper, scissors and ok) based on some reccord of the electrical activity produced by muscles when doing the movements.
